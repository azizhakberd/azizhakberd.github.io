			<h2>What About It?</h2>
			<p>
				There we'll discuss about how social medias are useful in companies and which are the best for them.<br>
				Before we'll know out why companies need social medias. Next we'll research and compare them to pick bests of them.
			</p>
			<h2><a name="whyneed"></a>Why social medias are need?</h2>
			<p>
				Social media - it's a place, where society will share a lot of information. How companies use it:<br>
				they're also advertise and sell their production: from food to software. They can get free account there to advertise their production, and people can see, but only if they visit that.<br>
				However, companies can pay to advertise. Then their ads will frequently appear in users' display.
				There're we've got two types of advertising: pulling ads, which pulls users, they are want to buy it. It's that free ads we've said. And pushing ads, users see them so much, that they could get interest to try it.

			<h2><a name="socmedresearch"></a>Social medias research</h2>
			<p>
				Social medias are different, each of them has got own original functions. Now I speak about the most popular of them
				<span class="h3">Telegram</span>
				<span class="p">
					Everyone knows Telegram, I sure that everyone among us used, uses and will use it. It's a messenger where we can share all types of information, communicate with everyone, who got Telegram, share photos, videos, files and another<br>
					How companies use it. Its ads. Telegram App don't do it, but they can advertise production in channels. For pulling ads they use own channels for free. To advert pushing ads they uses another popular channels. They're pay to the channels owner to advertise their production there.
				</span>
				<span class="h3">You Tube</span>
				<span class="p">
					You Tube is the platform to post videos. There companies can make channel for not only place there pulling ads, but for earn some money too. If their channel's followers' count increase a lot, Google will pay them some money! It can cover some expenses.<br>Pushing ads appear when users're watching UNPROOFED FROM ADS POPULAR videos. But it costs a lots of money.
				</span>
				<span class="h3">Instagram, Tik Tok, Facebook</span>
				<span class="p">
					They are only entertaining platforms. But who doesn't like have some fun! Unlike Telegram they have got advertising spaces and sell them for a lots of money. But pulling ads there is not so powerful because people there only for having fun.
					But some pulling ads could be placed there.
				</span>
				<span class="h3">Twitter</span>
				<span class="p">
					The most discussions of people're making there. And the lastest news appear first there too. This app use a lots of people, more than Telegram users.<br>
					So its advertising spaces are very expensive. Not each company can place there their ads. So you can see there only ads of big companies productions.
				</span>
				There're a lots of other social medias but they're not so popular or similar to these, ex. Viber, WhatsApp and Yandex.<br>
				<b>But</b> we need know, that compamies not only advertise in social media, but sells  advertising space for other companies. Selling advertising places - the most profitable buisness.  
			</p>
			<h2><a name="whichbest"></a>Pick The Best</h2>

				I have told about all social medias we need know.
				Now we make own discussion about which social medias are best for companies.
